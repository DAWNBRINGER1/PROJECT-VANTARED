# PROJECT-VANTARED


**PROJECT VANTARED** - Face Detection and Recognition System

Description:
Project VANTARED is an innovative face detection and recognition system designed for real-time applications. Leveraging a robust tech stack and cutting-edge libraries, this project seamlessly integrates computer vision and deep learning to achieve accurate and efficient facial recognition.

**Tech Stack:**
1. **OpenCV:** The project harnesses the power of OpenCV, a widely-used computer vision library, for real-time face detection. The Haar cascade classifier from OpenCV provides a reliable method for identifying faces in video streams.

2. **TensorFlow:** Deep learning capabilities are harnessed through TensorFlow, a versatile framework. This enables the utilization of powerful neural networks for facial recognition tasks.

3. **DeepFace Library:** For advanced face recognition, the project incorporates the DeepFace library. DeepFace facilitates accurate identification of individuals, enhancing the system's ability to match detected faces with known identities.

4. **PIL (Python Imaging Library):** Image processing tasks are seamlessly handled using the Python Imaging Library, ensuring optimal quality and manipulation of images captured during the face detection process.

5. **Matplotlib:** Matplotlib is employed for the visual representation of images, providing a user-friendly interface to display the output of the face detection and recognition system.

6. **Requests Library:** To enhance the project's functionality, the Requests library is utilized for making HTTP requests. This is particularly employed in retrieving geolocation information based on detected IP addresses.

**Key Features:**
- **Real-time Face Detection:** The system captures video frames in real-time from a default webcam, employing OpenCV for instantaneous face detection.
  
- **Deep Learning-Based Recognition:** TensorFlow and DeepFace combine forces to enable deep learning-based facial recognition, allowing the system to identify individuals accurately.

- **Image Capture and Display:** Incorporating JavaScript in a Jupyter/Colab environment, the project allows for on-demand image capture. The PIL library ensures efficient image handling, while Matplotlib provides a visually appealing display of the results.

- **Geolocation Integration:** The system goes beyond facial recognition by incorporating geolocation functionality. Utilizing the ipinfo.io API, the project provides an alert system indicating the suspected location based on the detected IP address.

- **Project Organization and Error Handling:** The project showcases effective organization by categorizing detected faces into matched and unmatched folders. Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented, moving images to an "undetected" folder when faces cannot be recognized.

Project VANTARED stands at the intersection of computer vision, deep learning, and geolocation, offering a comprehensive solution for face detection and recognition in real-world scenarios. The utilization of state-of-the-art libraries and a thoughtful tech stack ensures both accuracy and efficiency in identifying individuals and their potential locations.
